# An Oblivious Routing Scheme for Parallel Computing in General Embedded Networks

I am puttin my dissertation for posterities sake, as I hope it may be useful to someone. The TeX source was compiled using MaxTeX circa 2010. I have no idea if it still compiles, but who knows?

The compiled paper may be viewed [here](./Hughes_dissertation.pdf).

Note: althought this code is on GitHub, it is _not_ open source!
